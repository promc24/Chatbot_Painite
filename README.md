# Painite

Painite is a chatbot designed to aid people with mental health issues by capturing context from their messages and responding accordingly using conditional statements and files as intents. It is deployed on Facebook Messenger and it helps the user carry out self-assessment for various mental conditions. According to the result, by accessing the database, the bot sends the user (only if agreed by them) addresses and contact details of the main hospitals and support groups that deal with a certain condition or even suggest the user seek professional help if the result is moderate or severe.

Python was used to implement the project for the exception of the self-assessment screening site which was made with HTML.
